          <h2> Donations from Sunday April 10th through July 31st</h2>
          <p>National Volunteer Week is our official kickoff of our donation season. It remains open until July 31st. Seating for live classes online classes opens August 1st.</p>
          <h2> How can I donate?</h2>
          <p>Mailing and Paypal location will be posted on April 10th.</p>
          <h2> What do donations pay for?</h2>
          <p>The largest cost we have is the Blackboard Collaborate online classroom annual subscription at just under $5,000 a year. Under this subscription, each teaching volunteer has a classroom to use for the school year.</p>
          <p>Our second largest cost is the server that our site/LMS runs on. We serve about 7,000 students each year, so it takes a fully dedicated server with only the project on it so there are enough resources to meet peak demand and hold all of our data. Our introductory price wil expire, so I estimate the cost this coming school year will be about $2600.</p>
